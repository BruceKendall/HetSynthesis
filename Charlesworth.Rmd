Charlesworth (1980; all page and equation references to the 1st edition) does not dwell on differences in selection on annual birth rate vs. annual death rate, but there are hints. 
Here I try to trace things out, focusing on the discrete age-class models.

# Demographic definitions (chapter 1)
Discrete time:

* $m(x, t)$ is the number of female zygotes produced by a female aged $x$ in year $t$ (p. 4)
* $P(x,t)$ is the probability that a female of age $x$ at the start of the breeding season in year $t$ survives the subsequent year (p. 3)
* The quantity $f(x,t) = m(x,t) P(0,t)$ is named the "net fecundity" (p. 5, eq. 1.3). This is what Caswell calls the "fertility coefficient"
* Eq. (1.3) indicates that his models are what we would now call *prebreeding census models*, with the youngest age class being age 1.
* $l(x,t)$ is the "probability that a female survives from conception in year $t-x$ to age $x$ at the beginning of the breeding season in year $t$" (p. 10). It is defined as $l(x,t) = \prod_{y=1}^x P(x-y, t-y)$ (eq. 1.15). This is the "survival function"; note that $t$ indexes the *current* year, not the year that the cohort was born.
* $k(x,t)$, is "the net expectation of female offspring at age $x$, attributable to a female born at time $t-x$" (p. 10). It is called the "reproductive function," given as $k(x,t) = l(x,t) m(x,t)$ (eq. 1.16)

Continuous time:

* $m(x, t)$ is the rate of production of female zygotes  by a female aged $x$ at time $t$ (p. 13)
* $\mu(x,t)$ is the age-specific deat rate at time $t$ (p. 12)
* $l(x,t)$ is the "probability that a female survives from conception at time $t-x$ to age $x$ at time $t$" (p. 12). Called the "survival function," it is given by $l(x,t) = \exp\left[- \int_0^x \mu(y, t-y) dy \right]$ (eq. 1.22).
* $k(x,t)$, is the "reproductive function," given as $k(x,t) = l(x,t) m(x,t)$ (p. 13)

Throughout the book, Charlesworth distinguishes between males and females; analagous demographic parameters (and derived quantities) for males are indicated with an asterisk.

The remainder of chapter 1 is devoted to the dynamics of the age-structured models, under various assumptions about time-dependence and density-dependence in the parameters.
